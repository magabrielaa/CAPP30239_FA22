# Final Project Data

This directory contains the data I scoped and plan to utilize for my CAPP 30239 Data Visualization final project. 

One of the policy areas I am interested in is social policy, in particular the design of policy tools that can promote upwards social mobility towards the middle class and reduce extreme poverty.

Coming from Ecuador ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨, I wanted to take this opportunity to employ data visualization techniques to get a snapshot of how poverty looks like in my home country: how is it distributed, where is it concentrated (geographically but also by ethnicity, age groups and types of jobs). 

## About the data
Ecuador joined the [Open Government Partnership (OGP)](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/ecuador/) in July 2018, and has since published an Open Data Portal where public data from 95 institutions is now available in open format.

**Type of source:** Primary

**Format:** CSV

**Description:** This is official government data from the Social Registry, an institutional registry that was created to record people and households living under poverty in order to provide them with access to public services and conditional cash transfer programs. 

The data is published at the individual level, with a total of 3'212,065 obsevations. To make the data more manageable for the project, I aggregated it into the following csv files:
