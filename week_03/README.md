# Week 3

This repository contains my first steps diving into JavaScript's data visualization library [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).

## 1. COVID-19 Country Cases
First D3.js tutorial using COVID-19 data on country cases to build my first bar chart. ðŸ“Š

The following files correspond to this example:

- `covid.csv`  dataset obtained from the New York Times Open Data and the [Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)
- `index.html` HTML document 
- `script.js`  JavaScript containing D3 code

## 2. Library Visits
For my homework assignment, I created another bar chart in D3.js, this time on Chicago library visits during January 2022. The files that correspond to this assignment include:

- `library_visits_jan22.csv` dataset obtained from [Chicago's Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org) includes number of visits by library branch and zip code
- `homework.html` HTML document
- `homework.js` JavaScript with D3 bar chart code, including comments for each step
