    <h1>Poverty in Ecuador: An Overview</h1>
    <h2 class="section">The pandemic reverted a 10 year decline in poverty </h2>
    <div id="line-parent">
        <div id="line-desc">
            <p>Ecuador's poverty, as a percentage of the population, was on a declining trend since 2009.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic increased poverty back to 2009-2012 levels, peaking in 2020.</p>
            <p>Rural areas have been the most affected, with almost half (49%) falling under poverty.</p>
            <h3>Signs of Recovery?</h3>
            <p>2021 shows a decline in poverty across National, Urban, and Rural levels. However, with economic
                instability, crime, and inequality on the rise in 2022, returning to 2010's development will take time.

    <h2 class="section">Let's look at the geographical distribution of poverty</h2>

                <p> This first chart shows poverty normalized per 10.000 habitants and it shows
                    that poverty is concentrated in three provinces in the Coastal Region:
                    Esmeraldas, Guayas, and Manab√≠.

                <div id="legend2" class="legend"></div>
                <div id="chart2" class="chart-container"></div>
                <p> A look at the distribution of poverty by population shows us that that poverty
                    is widespread through Ecuador, not just in the Coast but also in the Highlands and
                    the Amazon. This more concerning picture suggests social policy should be focused in 
                    Esmeraldas and Bolivar.

                    is on parr with the higher proportion of women in the overall population. </p>

                <h3>Disparity among the poor</h3>
                <p>As expected with individuals living under poverty, most are unemployed.
                However, the proportion of females unemployed is more significant than that
                of males.</p>
                <p>Among the employed, the majority of men are day laborers, private
                    sector workers or self-employed.</p>
                <p>In the case of employed women under poverty, most are self-employed, followed
                    by day labor, which speaks to the precariousness of jobs that lack stability and
                    social protection.</p>

                    to a social welfare compared to 85,541 males.</p>
                <p>Not only are there more females living under poverty but 
                    also fewer of them are protected by the State.

                <p>If we look at total poverty (including moderate and extreme poverty), the gap

                <p>This gap shrinks when we focus on extreme poverty, with 56,192 indigenous peoples living 
                    under extreme poverty compared to 82,580 mestizos.</p>

                <h3>Why is this concerning?</h3>
                <p>72% of the population self-identifies as mestizo compared to only 7% self-identifies
                    as indigenous.  </p>
                <p>This means that indigenous peoples are a minority drastically affected by extreme
                    poverty. </p>

                <p>Indigenous populations are concentrated in rural areas, which have also been particularly 
                    affected by the pandemic.
