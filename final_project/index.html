    <h1>Poverty in Ecuador: An Overview</h1>
    <h2 class="section">Let's look at the geographical distribution of poverty</h2>
    <div id="container">
        <div id="map-parent">
            <div class = "map">
                <h2> Poverty appears to be concentrated in the coastal region</h2>
                <div id="legend1" class="legend"></div>
                <div id="chart1" class="chart-container"></div>
                <p> This first chart shows poverty normalized per 10.000 habitants and it shows
                    that poverty is concentrated in three provinces in the Coastal Region:
                    Esmeraldas, Guayas, and Manab√≠.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="map">
                <h2> But it is evenly spread as a proportion of population size</h2>
                <div id="legend2" class="legend"></div>
                <div id="chart2" class="chart-container"></div>
                <p> A look at the distribution of poverty by population shows us that that poverty
                    is widespread through Ecuador, not just in the Coast but also in the Highlands and
                    the Amazon. This more concerning picture suggests social policy should be focused in 
                    Esmeraldas and Bolivar.

            <div id="gender-desc">
                <p>The distribution of poverty in Ecuador between males and females is similar.</p>
                <p>There are 1.44% more females living under poverty than males, a small difference that
                    is on parr with the higher proportion of women in the overall population. </p>

                <h3>Disparity among the poor</h3>
                <p>As expected with individuals living under poverty, most are unemployed.
                However, the proportion of females unemployed is more significant than that
                of males.</p>
                <p>Among the employed, the majority of men are day laborers, private
                    sector workers or self-employed.</p>
                <p>In the case of employed women under poverty, most are self-employed, followed
                    by day labor, which speaks to the precariousness of jobs that lack stability and
                    social protection.</p>

        <h2 class="section">Fewer females in poverty have access to social security</h2>
        <div id="ring-parent">
            <div id="ring-desc">
                <p>There is a marked difference in access to social
                    security among the poor. 52,439 females have access
                    to a social welfare compared to 85,541 males.</p>
                <p>Not only are there more females living under poverty but 
                    also fewer of them are protected by the State.
