            <h3>Rural Areas Hit Hardest</h3>
            <p>Ecuador's poverty, as a percentage of the population, was on a declining trend since 2009.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic increased poverty back to 2009-2012 levels, peaking in 2020.</p>
            <p>Rural areas have been the most affected, with almost half (49%) falling under poverty.</p>
            <h3>Signs of Recovery?</h3>
            <p>2021 shows a decline in poverty across National, Urban, and Rural levels. However, with economic
                instability, crime, and inequality on the rise in 2022, returning to 2010's development will take time.

            <h3 id="recommendations-1">My interest in the topic</h3>
            <p>Growing up in Ecuador, I have witnessed the decline in extreme poverty over the last two decades. This decline was a result
                of both economic growth (due to an increase in oil production in the 2010's), as well as social policy oriented to promote
                upward social mobility. Policy examples include Conditional Cash Transfers, housing bonds, and bonds for people with
                disabilities living in poverty, among others.</p>
            <p>Since 2018, Ecuador was already facing several macroeconomic hardships, including a recession and an unprecedented level of
                public debt. The pandemic led to a <span class="italic">“deep recession that had a major impact  on growing poverty levels in
                Ecuador.”</span> <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/ecuador/overview">(World Bank)</a> Ecuador is one of the
                countries hit hardest by the pandemic. According to the World Health Organization, in terms of confirmed deaths per million
                habitants, <span class="italic">"Ecuador ranks fourth in the Americas and ninth worldwide."</span>
                <a href="https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32567-4/fulltext">(WHO, October 2022)</a>
            </p>
            <p>As an Ecuadorian interested in social policy, I find these reports very alarming. The economic hardship remains now a common
                dinner table topic back home and I thought this project would be a good opportunity to explore data on poverty and understand
                not only how it has evolved over time, but also which groups are most affected.</p>
            <h3 id="recommendations">About the data</h3>
            <p>The main data source I used for this project is the <a href="https://www.datosabiertos.gob.ec/dataset/conjunto-de-datos-personas-del-registro-social">
                Social Registry</a>: a government registry that was created to record people and households living under poverty in order to provide them with
                access to social protection programmes. This information has historically been reserved for institutional use. However, since Ecuador joined the
                <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/ecuador/"> Open Government Partnership</a> in July 2018, an <a href="https://www.datosabiertos.gob.ec">
                Open Data Portal</a> has been recently launched, which now makes the data available to the public.</p>
            <p>I opted for the Social Registry data for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Official source</li>
                <li>Updated to 2021</li>
                <li>Largest dataset containing population living under poverty</li>
                <li>Anonimized data covering 3.2 million people</li>
                <li>Clean, well-structured data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other data options for this topic include the statistical reports from the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), which I do use
                complementarily. For example, I used <a href="https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/pobreza-junio-2022/">series data on poverty rates</a> from INEC's tabulated
                datasets for the area chart, and <a href="https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/informacion-censal-cantonal/">data on rural households</a> by province.
            </p>
            <h3 id="sub-title">Data Caveat</h3>
            <p>The main limitation from this dataset is that it only contains observations of people under poverty who at some point self-registered or were registered
                by a third party in the Social Registry. Even though it is the most complete data available, it is not a 100% comprehensive of all people living under poverty
                in Ecuador. This means the reality may be much harsher, in particular for families who live in remote areas and cannot access social services.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="col2">
            <h3 id="recommendations">The Story</h3>
            <p>At the beginning, I was interested in a profile of poverty in Ecuador but I was not sure which way the story would go. I wanted to define the story
                from the patterns I could identify in the data. This meant that I had to try a lot of different charts to visualize what poverty looked like at different
                levels: urban vs. rural, and by categories such as gender and ethnicity. Ultimately, I opted to focus on the <b>disparity among the poor</b> and came to realize
                that indigenous peoples are by far the most severely group affected by extreme poverty, as well as females. The degree of this disparity was a shocking result
                and one that I have not seen highlighted in the news or by NGO's.
            </p>
            <h3 id="recommendations">Chart Selections</h3>
            <p>My goal was to balance using a varied selection of charts, while also communicating the story clearly. I used an <b>area chart</b> to visualize poverty rates
               by levels because it emphasized that the rural proportion of poverty is larger. I included a vertical line and an annotation to direct the viewer to the poverty
               rate peak in 2020.</p>
            <p>The <b>maps</b> were used to show a clear relationship between the provinces with the highest poverty concentrations and those with the most rural households. It
                helps to further emphasize the point that rural poverty accounts for most poverty in the country. The fact that each map comes from a different data source and shows
                this visual correlation, gives more credence to the story. </p>
            <p>I used the <b>treemap</b> and <b>horizontal chart</b> side-by-side to draw attention to the main point of the story: that even though indigenous peoples are a
               minority, they are the demographic group most gravely affected by extreme poverty. I also decided to color only the "Indigenous" category to highlight this
               comparison.</p>
            <p>For the section on <b>gender</b>, I employed color scheme consistency through the different graphs so the viewer would associate females and males more easily. The
                <b>parallel chart</b> was handy to compare the precariousness between females and males. Since there are only two categories on the left, I thought it would be
                manageable for the viewer to follow the story through this graph. This was also the reason I chose <b>pie charts</b> to compare access to social security by gender.
                It's easier to make the point of no access to social security, without further categories that make a pie chart difficult to read.
            </p>
            <h3 id="recommendations">Challenges</h3>
            <p>On the data processing side, one of the challenges was translating all the datasets from Spanish to English, in particular for specific terms that are context-specific,
                such as the categorization used for employment types by the National Statistics Insitute.
            </p>
            <p>On the coding side, I had some difficulty with the legends, ie. finding the right buckets for the map legends and 
                getting the Swatches function to to work. The maps also required adjustment because the projection did not render them visible in the first attempts.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, it was a good learning experience on how to use D3.js and communicate a story clearly.</p>
