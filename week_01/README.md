### Hello! :wave:

I am a 2nd year MSCAPP student at the University of Chicago. I am from Ecuador and I absolutely **love dogs and chocolate**. I have three chihuahuas and one of them, Ramona, lives with me here in Chicago.

I am looking forward to learn about different data visualization techniques and how they make come in handy for public policy issues. Here's my data selfie that says a little more about me. [^1]
